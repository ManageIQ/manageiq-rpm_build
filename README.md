# ManageIQ RPM Build

This repository contains code to build RPMs for ManageIQ appliances and container images:

  * Clone source repos
  * Run bundle install, compiles assets for UI and a few other tasks needed
  * Create tarballs
  * Build RPMs (locally in the container image or in Copr)

## Steps

1. Build container image

2. Prepare configuration

   - Create a local directory with an `options.yml` with the configuration changes
     you want to make, then when running the container image, mount that directory
     with `-v <dir>:/root/OPTIONS`.
   - If overriding the NPM registry, set the `npm_registry` key in the `options.yml`.
   - If building RPMs in Copr,
     - set the `rpm.repo_name` key in the `options.yml`.
     - run the container image with `-v <copr token file>:/root/.config/copr`.
   - If updating the RPM repo it would be helpful to attach a volume to hold the RPM cache with `-v <dir>:/root/rpm_cache`.
     Any RPMs not in the cache will be downloaded to the cache first.

3. Start the container image

   `docker run -it <image>`

4. Run the script

   - Run `bin/build.rb`, optionally overriding git ref (branch or tag) and release type

     ```
     bin/build.rb --git-ref jansa --update-rpm-repo
     ```
     ```
     bin/build.rb --build-type release --git-ref jansa-1-alpha1 --update-rpm-repo
     ```

Alternatively, the build can be started directly by passing `build` to the
`docker run` command:

```
docker run -it <miq-rpm_build image> build [--build-type <type>] [--git-ref <ref>] [--update-rpm-repo]
```

The container will exit after the build is completed. Use `-v <dir>:/root/BUILD` to
mount a volume, if artifacts need to be accessed later.

## Artifacts

manageiq-core, manageiq-gemset and manageiq-appliance .tar.gz will be created in `~/BUILD/rpm_spec/`

manageiq-* RPMs will be created in `~/BUILD/rpms` if built locally
